# FPGA Modulation Techniques Project

## Overview

This project implements various modulation techniques using FPGA technology as part of a practical engineering final project. The system allows users to input data in bytes, select a modulation type, and generate an analog output signal. The output signal can be observed and analyzed on an oscilloscope.

## Features

- **User Input**: Data input in bytes for modulation processing.
- **Modulation Selection**: Multiple modulation techniques to choose from.
- **Analog Signal Output**: Clear analog signal output visible on an oscilloscope.

## Usage

1. Enter data in bytes.
2. Select the desired modulation type.
3. View the resulting analog signal on an oscilloscope. 

## Technologies Used

- **FPGA**: Implements the modulation techniques.
- **Oscilloscope**: Used to observe the output signal.

This project showcases the practical application of FPGA technology in real-time signal modulation and processing.
